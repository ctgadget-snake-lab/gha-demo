# Tutorials

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of setting up and running a FastAPI application on your local machine. We'll also cover how to test the different endpoints of your FastAPI application.

# Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Pip (Python package manager)

# Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

It's a good practice to work within a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
# Create a new directory for your FastAPI project
mkdir my_fastapi_project
cd my_fastapi_project
```

## Create a virtual environment
`python -m venv venv`

## Activate the virtual environment
### On Windows:
`venv\Scripts\activate`

### On macOS and Linux:
`source venv/bin/activate`
